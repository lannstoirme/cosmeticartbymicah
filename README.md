Wordpress Custom Theme

This theme was created as a custom Wordpress theme for a client. 

The client had migrated from Wix, and liked to execute a large degree of control over her website, and this allowed her to upload blog entries, additional information and photographs to her website. 

Inititally her original standard Wordpress site was satisfactory, however the menu system became extended and navigation became confusing as the client added more information and more pages. 

A redesign was presented, to allow the client to have a backend Wordpress environment where the client could add whatever information that they desired, but without affecting the main navigation of the website. This ensured that the useability of the website stayed intact, and the navigation maintained integrity. 

The navigation is notably removed from this site, and allows the coder to overlay a structured HTML Bootstrap site to it in addition, in order to prevent a client from degrading the integrity of the site. The site works in conjunction with the Wordpress site, and the Wordpress site was installed on a subdomain of the site. The client was happy with the end result, it enabled her to exercise a great deal of control over her own site, and take ownership of it, whilst still maintaining quality user experience. 

The site was designed in conjunction with the client based on the Italian Vogue website, with a black and white minimalist theme, some iconic logo design, and colour added through any additional photographs. The Facebook logo, and Instagram logo are included, and the link can simply be changed to whichever relevant link is required.
